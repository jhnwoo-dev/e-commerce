# Challenge 13 - ORM: E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The motivation for this project was to build the back end for an e-commerce site.
This project was built for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that the hiring company could compete with other e-commerce companies.
This solves the problem of not having an e-commerce website that had the latest technology.
I learned how to create a robust back end of an e-commerce website with multiple routes and models.

## Installation

You will run the normal git clone procedures. Once the repo has been cloned, open the terminal and run the command "npm i" to install the dependencies necessary to run the application. From there, you can open a new terminal from the schema file and run your sql commands to set up your databases. After that, navigate back to the terminal on the root level, and seed your database by running "npm run seed" and proceed to run "nodemon" afterwards to get your server up and running. From there, navigate to the proper localhost port and test out the functionality with an application like Insomnia.
